 Try-- A try block identifies a block of code for which particular exceptions is activated. It is followed by
       one or more catch blocks.
  
 Finally---The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not 
           thrown. For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is thrown or not.
      

Every try block could contain a respective finally block. The code within the
finally block is always executed, no matter how the program flow leaves the
try block. This guarantees that the finally block will be executed even if an
exception is thrown or a return statement is executed within the try block.

Use the using statement with all classes that implement the
IDisposable interface.
Using exceptions allow us to separate the code, which describes the normal
execution of the program from the code required for unexpected execution
and the code for error handling.
