Exception is a problem that arises during the execution of a program. A C# exception is a response to an exceptional
circumstance that arises while a program is running, such as an attempt to divide by Zero.
     Exceptions provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another.C# exceprion handling is built
upon four keywords:try,catch,finally and throw.  
    
      Assuming a block raises an exception, a method catches an exception using a combination of the try and catch and finally key
